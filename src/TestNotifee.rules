Step 1: Get your Project ID
Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings (⚙️).

Copy the Project ID (e.g., mychat-app-12345).

In Thunder Client, set your URL to:
https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/messages:send

Step 2: Get your Bearer Token (The "Secret" Key)
Since v1 is more secure, you can't just copy a key from the console. You need a temporary token.

Go to the Google OAuth2 Playground.

In the "Input your own scopes" box (Step 1), paste this:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/firebase.messaging

Click Authorize APIs and log in.

Click Exchange authorization code for tokens (Step 2).

Copy the Access Token (starts with ya29...).

Step 3: Setup Thunder Client
Method: POST

Headers tab:

Content-Type: application/json

Authorization: Bearer PASTE_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE

Body tab (JSON): Paste your code exactly as you had it:
